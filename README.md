# Description
This repository contains solutions to programming problems in Java that are important for the 2021 ISC Exam. All the code provided in this repository is my version of the correct answer to the question provided. Note that I do not take responsibility for any damages caused to you by my code.

# Problems
1. An implementation of Binary Search.
2. An implementation of Selection Sort.
3. An implementation of Insertion Sort.
4. A program to multiply two matrices.
5. A program to calculate the days between two dates.
6. A program to convert binary number to decimal number.
7. Write a program to accept a sentence which may be terminated by either ‘.’ , ‘?’ or ‘!’
only. The words are to be separated by a single blank space and are in lower case.
Perform the following tasks: (i) Check for the validity of the accepted sentence and for the terminating character. (ii) Arrange the words contained in the sentence according to the size of the words in ascending order. If two words are of the same length then the first occurring comes first. The sentence should begin with a capital alphabet in both the cases i.e. Input and Output. (iii) Display both the sentences separately with each sentence beginning with a capital alphabet.

    Example:

        Input: -

        the lines are printed in reverse order.

        Output: -

        The lines are printed in reverse order.
        In the are lines order printed reverse.
